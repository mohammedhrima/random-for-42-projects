- a contains number, b is empty
- not duplicated
- sort numbers in stack a

the allowed moves:
	sa: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack a
	sb: swap 2 first elements at the top of stack b
	ss: do sa and sb at the same time
	pa: put first element of at the top of b and put it at the top of a
	pb: put first element of at the top of a and put it at the top of b
	ra: shift all elements of stack a by 1
	rb: shift all elements of stack b by 1
	rr: do ra and rb
	rra: reverse ra
	rrb: reverse rb
	rrr: rra and rrb at the same time


* create sorted array of  0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7...
- check repetitive numbers
- sort numbers (with index)
- check meme functions
- rotate up
- reverse rotate down

- method for 3 numbers
- method for 5 numbers
- method for 100 numbers
- method for 500 numbers


- in push A to B:
	copy first elemnt of A
	rotate A up
	rotate B down
	put copyed number at the top of B
	decrease A->lenght by 1
	increase B->lenght by 1

x < 3    | 1 -> 2 moves
x <= 5   | 8 -> 12 moves
x <= 100 | 700 -> 1100 moves
x <= 500 | 5500 -> 11500 moves


saad:
	x <= 10  ->	5
	x <= 150 -> 8
	x >	 150 ->	15 

for 5 <= x <= 8:
	5 : send 2 biggers to B and sort 3 in A
	6 : send 3 biggers to B and sort 3 in A and 3 in B
	7 : send 3 biggers to B and sort them in B, send fourth bigger number to B, sort A
	8 : send 3 biggers to B and sort them in B, send fourth and fifth biggers number to B, (check if swap them in B), sort A


4 -> 1 + 3
5 -> 2 + 3
6 -> 3 + 3
7 -> 3 + 1(min) + 3

// sub squence : send numbers more than the half to other side and check subsquences
// subsequence doesn't care about how much numbers


// at the remove structs that contains value and index and keep the index
